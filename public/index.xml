      <description>h1 {text-align: center;}Setting the StageMy girlfriend and I were talking the other day about how weird it is that most American states seem to have capitals that are not their biggest city. Upon further discussion, I thought of big cities like Salt Lake City, Utah (where I live), that actually are the state capital and the biggest city. So we really wanted to know ‘are there more of the biggest cities in each state that aren’t the capital versus those that are?</description>

      <description>Hello, and thanks for visiting my blog! My name is Hal Svien; this is my data science blog where I’ll explore some data sets and answer questions that I find interesting. See the About section for more about me and my background, education, and my approach to this blog.
I’ll include my citations with every post, and you’ll notice some come up frequently. I’ll end up using books by Scott Baldwin, Rex Kline, Neil Salkind, and Rebecca Warner because they are very elaborative, often giving examples from simulation data or the like to show you why what they’re discussing is accurate.</description>
