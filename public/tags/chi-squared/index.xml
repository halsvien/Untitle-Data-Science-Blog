      <description>h1 {text-align: center;}Setting the StageMy girlfriend and I were talking the other day about how weird it is that most American states seem to have capitals that are not their largest city.

So we really wanted to know ‘are there more of the largest cities in each state that aren’t the capital versus those that are?</description>
