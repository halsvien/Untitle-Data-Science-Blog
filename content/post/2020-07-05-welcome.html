<p>Hello, and thanks for visiting my blog! My name is Hal Svien; this is my data science blog where I’ll explore some data sets and answer questions that I find interesting. See the About section for more about me and my background, education, and my approach to this blog.</p>
<p>I’ll include my citations with every post, and you’ll notice some come up frequently. I’ll end up using books by Scott Baldwin, Rex Kline, Neil Salkind, and Rebecca Warner because they are very elaborative, often giving examples from simulation data or the like to show you why what they’re discussing is accurate. I’ll often try to emulate this in my posts. I’ll also lean on Roger Peng’s works because he has useful and informative books on R.</p>
