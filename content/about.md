My name is Hal Svien; I'm currently a product analyst in the financial tech industry. Check out the LinkedIn page on this site to see more about me and my work history. I have a master's degree in psychology from Brigham Young University. I'm currently in the [data science professional certificate through HarvardX](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science).

I'm going to use this data science blog to explore cool uses of statistics and data science techniques. I was mostly trained in the general linear model of statistics, so over time I might try to take on projects where I use the generalized linear model, machine learning, and structural equation modeling (which I already know, to some degree). 

My general approach to posts here will be to lay out what I'm doing and why; this will typically look like a short discussion into what I'm doing and links to any data or articles, how I'm going to do it and why I use certain methods over others, and a review of findings along with any admonishments we should probably make about the data in question. Please feel free to give me any feedback you have about anything in this blog!

I use the [**blogdown**] package in R to create this site. You can find the Github repository link at the top of the page. You can also find my contact information near there.
